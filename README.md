## About the Project:

Gas leakages resulting in fatal inferno has become a serious problem in the household and other areas where household gas is handled and used. Gas leakage leads to various accidents resulting in financial loss as well as human injuries and/or loss.

The work aims at designing a system that detects gas leakage and alerts the subscriber through alarm and status display beside turning off the gas supply valve as a primary safety measure. An additional functionality of a GSM enabled SMS Alert system is also made.
